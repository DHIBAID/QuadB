# My name is Dhiraj Baid
My sister Gunjan Baid applied for an internship thru `Internshala`, I am a 10th grade student studying in IB board, living in surat.
I have made this website by myself. 
Using `NodeJS, HTML, CSS, and a bit of jQuery`
Please let me know if I get selected, this would be a great opportunity for me to learn. 
Also I can devote **4-5 hours daily** for the internship, this is my first intership.

*Looking forward to work with you!*
